Athletic fields stretch wide, alive with cheers and the pounding rhythm of running feet. Art spills from studios—paint-stained hands shaping beauty from nothing. In quiet corners, solitary figures write futures in notebooks worn by use. The night air carries whispers of debates still lingering in the open air. Dorm windows flicker with the warm light of stories shared too late into the night. And as dawn rises, the campus awakens again, ready to shape another day of dreams.',
